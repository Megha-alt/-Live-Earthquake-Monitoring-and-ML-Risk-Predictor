# -Live-Earthquake-Monitoring-and-ML-Risk-Predictor
A Machine Learning model using RandomForestRegressor to analyze live recent earthquake data, detect risk spikes, and predict risk scores.
This project focuses on monitoring recent real-time earthquake activity and estimating the risk level based on seismic parameters.
Using live earthquake data, the model analyzes magnitude and depth, detects whether activity is normal or spiked, and predicts a continuous risk score.
It also visualizes risk trends and magnitude–risk patterns to make seismic behavior easy to understand.

# 🔎 Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to track recent live seismic readings and interpret the risk associated with them.
The model uses:

Live magnitude data

Live depth readings

Recent seismic fluctuations

- Based on this, the system generates:

A risk score

Spike vs Normal activity status

A risk-rate trend graph

This helps in understanding how risky the current seismic environment is in real time.
